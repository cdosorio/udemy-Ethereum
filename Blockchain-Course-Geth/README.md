# Hands on Blockchain for Developers and Arhitects

Part of a course.

On Windows:   Run .bat files to launch geth

On Linux/Mac: The shell scripts are under bash subfolder
              
*OR* Simply copy and paste the commands from the files to the terminal
   
To use the commands:   
   
1. Create a local directory  
2. Open a terminal window   
   > geth-testnet   
   This would setup the data directories for chain data ./data   
3. Open a new terminal window   
   > geth-testnet.attach   
   This would open a console to the running geth   
   
Try out the other files to learn geth CLI   

PS: Ensure terminal windows are open with the current directory as the one that you created
