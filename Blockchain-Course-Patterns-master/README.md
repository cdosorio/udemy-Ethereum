If you see compiler warnings related to Throw;
It is because the Throw statement is deprecated & replaced by revert()

There are 2 solutions:
You may ignore these warnings
Change the throw to revert() but then you may go out of sync

Over next couple of weeks, I will update the code to reflect the deprecatin related change.
