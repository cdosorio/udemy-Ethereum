/**
 * Part of the Ethereum DAPPs design and development course
 * http://ACloudFan.com
 * 
 * Implements a simple ERC20 Token
 * V1 >> Implements simple token that does not support approve/transferFrom & allowance function
 *       This version will not be ERC20 compliant as it does not implement all specs funcs/events
 * V2 >> Supports the approve/transferFrom & allowance function
 * V3 >> Add some admin functions that only the owner of the coin can execute
 * 
 * Walkthrough is in Section#9 of course

  // E.g., decimals = 2, value=100 interpretted as 1.00
  // E.g., decimals = 1, value=100 interpretted as 10.0

// Note that the number of decimal places is just a display/UI issue. All tokens are transacted in integer numbers of units, from 1 to totalSupply.

// E.g. If I sent you one unit of some token and decimals is three for that token, then it would be displayed that I had sent you 0.001 tokens, but under the hood it's just a transfer of one unit.
